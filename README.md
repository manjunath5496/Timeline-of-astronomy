<li><strong>3114 BC:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_astronomy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mayan astronomers</a>&nbsp;discover an 18.6-year cycle in the rising and setting of the Moon. From this they created the first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">almanacs</a>&nbsp;&ndash; tables of the movements of the Sun, Moon and planets for the use in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">astrology</a>. In 6th century BC Greece, this knowledge is used to predict&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">eclipses</a>.</li>

<li><strong>467 BC:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxagoras" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Anaxagoras</a>&nbsp;produced a correct explanation for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">eclipses</a>&nbsp;and then described the Sun as a fiery mass larger than the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnese" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Peloponnese</a>&nbsp;, as well as attempting to explain&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">rainbows</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">meteors</a>&nbsp;. He was the first to explain that the Moon shines due to reflected light from the Sun.</li>
<li><strong>400 BC:&nbsp;</strong>Around this date, Babylonians use the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">zodiac</a>&nbsp;to divide the heavens into twelve equal segments of thirty degrees each, the better to record and communicate information about the position of celestial bodies.</li>
<li><strong>387 BC:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Plato</a>, a Greek philosopher, founds a school (the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Platonic Academy</a>) that will influence the next 2000 years. It promotes the idea that everything in the universe moves in harmony and that the Sun, Moon, and planets move around Earth in perfect circles.</li>
<li><strong>270 BC:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aristarchus of Samos</a>&nbsp;proposes&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">heliocentrism</a>&nbsp;as an alternative to the Earth-centered universe. His heliocentric model places the Sun at its center, with Earth as just one planet orbiting it. However, there were only a few people who took the theory seriously.</li>
<li><strong>240 BC:&nbsp;</strong>The earliest recorded sighting of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Halley's Comet</a>&nbsp;is made by Chinese astronomers. Their records of the comet's movement allow astronomers today to predict accurately how the comet's orbit changes over the centuries.</li>
<li><strong>6 BC:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Magi</a>&nbsp;- probably Persian astronomers/astrologers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Astrology</a>) - observed a planetary conjunction on Saturday (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sabbath</a>) April 17, 6 BC that signified the birth of a great&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hebrew</a>&nbsp;king:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jesus</a>.</li>
<li><strong>4 BC:&nbsp;</strong>The astronomer&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Shen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Shi Shen</a>&nbsp;is believed to have cataloged 809 stars in 122 constellations, and he also made the earliest known observation of sunspots.</li>
<li><strong>140:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ptolemy</a>&nbsp;publishes his&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_catalogue" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">star catalogue</a>, listing 48&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">constellations</a>&nbsp;and endorses the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">geocentric</a>&nbsp;(Earth-centered) view of the universe. His views go unquestioned for nearly 1500 years in Europe, and are passed down to Arabic and medieval European astronomers in his book the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Almagest</a>.</li>
<li><strong>400:</strong>&nbsp;The Hindu cosmological time cycles explained in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Siddhanta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Surya Siddhanta</a>, give the average length of the sidereal year (the length of the Earth's revolution around the Sun) as 365.2563627 days, which is only 1.4 seconds longer than the modern value of 365.256363004 days.&nbsp;This remains the most accurate estimate for the length of the sidereal year anywhere in the world for over a thousand years.</li>
<li><strong>499:&nbsp;</strong>Indian mathematician-astronomer&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aryabhata</a>, in his&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatiya" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aryabhatiya</a>&nbsp;first identifies the force gravity to explain why objects do not fall when the Earth rotates,&nbsp;propounds a geocentric Solar System of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gravitation</a>, and an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(mathematics)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">eccentric</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">elliptical</a>&nbsp;model of the planets, where the planets spin on their&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">axis</a>&nbsp;and follow elliptical orbits, the Sun and the Moon revolve around the Earth in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">epicycles</a>. He also writes that the planets and the Moon do not have their own light but reflect the light of the Sun, and that the Earth rotates on its axis causing day and night and also that the Sun rotates around the Earth causing years.</li>
<li><strong>628:&nbsp;</strong>Indian mathematician-astronomer&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Brahmagupta</a>, in his&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmasphutasiddhanta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta</a>, first recognizes gravity as a force of attraction, and briefly describes the second law of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Newton's law of universal gravitation</a>. He gives methods for calculations of the motions and places of various planets, their rising and setting, conjunctions, and calculations of the solar and lunar eclipses.</li>
<li><strong>773:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sanskrit</a>&nbsp;works of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aryabhata</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Brahmagupta</a>, along with the Sanskrit text&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Siddhanta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Surya Siddhanta</a>, are translated into&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Arabic</a>, introducing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_astronomy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Arabic astronomers</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_astronomy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Indian astronomy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>777:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Fazari" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Muhammad al-Fazari</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%CA%BFq%C5%ABb_ibn_%E1%B9%AC%C4%81riq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Yaʿqūb ibn Ṭāriq</a>&nbsp;translate the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Siddhanta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Surya Siddhanta</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmasphutasiddhanta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Brahmasphutasiddhanta</a>, and compile them as the&nbsp;Zij al-Sindhind, the first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zij" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Zij</a>&nbsp;treatise.</li>
<li><strong>830:&nbsp;</strong>The first major&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_astronomy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Arabic work of astronomy</a>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Zij al-Sindh&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">al-Khwarizimi</a>. The work contains tables for the movements of the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets known at the time. The work is significant as it introduced Ptolemaic concepts into Islamic sciences. This work also marks the turning point in Arabic astronomy. Hitherto, Arabic astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of nontraditional methods of study and calculations.</li>
<li><strong>850:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfraganus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">al-Farghani</a>&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;Kitab fi Jawani&nbsp;("<strong>A compendium of the science of stars</strong>"). The book primarily gave a summary of Ptolemic cosmography. However, it also corrected Ptolemy based on findings of earlier Arab astronomers. Al-Farghani gave revised values for the obliquity of the ecliptic, the precessional movement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">apogees</a>&nbsp;of the Sun and the Moon, and the circumference of the Earth. The books were widely circulated through the Muslim world, and even translated into&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Latin</a>.</li>
<li><strong>928:&nbsp;</strong>The earliest surviving&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">astrolabe</a>&nbsp;is constructed by Islamic&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mathematician</a>&ndash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">astronomer</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_al-Fazari" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mohammad al-Fazari</a>. Astrolabes are the most advanced instruments of their time. The precise measurement of the positions of stars and planets allows Islamic astronomers to compile the most detailed&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">almanacs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_atlas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">star atlases</a>&nbsp;yet.</li>
<li><strong>1030:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_Ray%E1%B8%A5%C4%81n_al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī</a>&nbsp;discussed the Indian heliocentric theories of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aryabhata</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Brahmagupta</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Var%C4%81hamihira" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Varāhamihira</a>&nbsp;in his&nbsp;Ta'rikh al-Hind&nbsp;(Indica&nbsp;in Latin). Biruni stated that the followers of Aryabhata consider the Earth to be at the center. In fact, Biruni casually stated that this does not create any mathematical problems.</li>
<li><strong>1031:&nbsp;</strong>Abu Said Sinjari, a contemporary of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Rayhan_Biruni" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Abu Rayhan Biruni</a>, suggested the possible heliocentric movement of the Earth around the Sun.</li>
<li><strong>1054:&nbsp;</strong>Chinese astronomers record the sudden appearance of a bright star. Native-American rock carvings also show the brilliant star close to the Moon. This star is the Crab&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">supernova</a>&nbsp;exploding.</li>
<li><strong>1070:&nbsp;</strong>Abu Ubayd al-Juzjani published the&nbsp;Tarik al-Aflak. In his work, he indicated the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equant" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">equant</a>" problem of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ptolemic model</a>. Al-Juzjani even proposed a solution for the problem. In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">al-Andalus</a>, the anonymous work&nbsp;al-Istidrak ala Batlamyus&nbsp;(meaning "<strong>Recapitulation regarding Ptolemy</strong>"), included a list of objections to the Ptolemic astronomy. One of the most important works in this period was&nbsp;Al-Shuku ala Batlamyus&nbsp;("<strong>Doubts on Ptolemy</strong>"). In this, the author summed up the inconsistencies of the Ptolemic models. Many astronomers took up the challenge posed in this work, namely to develop alternate models that evaded such errors.</li>

<li><strong>1350:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Shatir" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ibn al-Shatir</a>&nbsp;(1304&ndash;1375), in his&nbsp;A Final Inquiry Concerning the Rectification of Planetary Theory, eliminated the need for an equant by introducing an extra epicycle, departing from the Ptolemaic system in a way very similar to what&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Copernicus</a>&nbsp;later also did. Ibn al-Shatir proposed a system that was only approximately geocentric, rather than exactly so, having demonstrated&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">trigonometrically</a>&nbsp;that the Earth was not the exact center of the universe.

However, he complicates his theory by retaining Plato's perfect circular orbits of the planets.</li>
<li><strong>1572:&nbsp;</strong>A brilliant supernova (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1572" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SN 1572</a>&nbsp;- thought, at the time, to be a comet) is observed by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tycho Brahe</a>, who proves that it is traveling beyond Earth's atmosphere and therefore provides the first evidence that the heavens can change.</li>
